These intents and entities will provide a solid foundation for your Dialogflow agent in ChainSync, covering common retail-specific queries and interactions that store staff might need. The training phrases are designed to capture real retail scenarios, and the entities will help extract important parameters from user queries.

To implement these in your Dialogflow agent, you would need to:

Log into the Google Cloud Console and navigate to your Dialogflow agent
Create each of the entities first
Create each intent with their training phrases and parameter mappings
Connect your Dialogflow agent to the webhook you've implemented in ChainSync
