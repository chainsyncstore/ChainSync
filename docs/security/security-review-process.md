# ChainSync Security Review Process

## Introduction

This document outlines the security review process for the ChainSync retail chain management system. It defines the schedule, scope, methodology, and workflows for security audits, static analysis, and penetration testing. The process is designed to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities while minimizing disruption to development workflows.

### Event-Driven Reviews

Additional security reviews will be triggered by:

- Major releases (version increments)
- Significant architectural changes
- New integration with external systems
- Changes to authentication or authorization mechanisms
- Updates to payment processing functionality
- Regulatory requirement changes

## Code Areas and Risk Classification

### Critical Risk Areas

These areas receive enhanced scrutiny and require security team approval for changes:

- **Authentication Service**: Token generation, validation, session management
- **Authorization Logic**: Permission checks, role-based access control
- **Payment Processing**: Integration with payment gateways, transaction handling
- **Customer Data Handling**: PII storage, access, and processing
- **API Security**: Input validation, rate limiting, CORS configuration
- **Secret Management**: Storage and usage of API keys, passwords, and tokens

### High Risk Areas

These areas receive regular security review:

- **Inventory Management**: Stock adjustment, transfer operations
- **Loyalty Program**: Points calculation, tier management
- **Store Management**: Store creation, configuration, and access control
