# ADR-001: Service Standardization Pattern

## Date

2025-05-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the ChainSync application grew, we observed inconsistent service implementation patterns across the codebase. Different services used varying approaches for error handling, dependency injection, transaction management, and resilience. This inconsistency led to several challenges:

1. **Developer Onboarding**: New team members had to learn multiple patterns to understand the codebase
2. **Maintenance Complexity**: Bug fixes and feature additions required context-switching between patterns
3. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Error reporting was inconsistent, making troubleshooting difficult
4. **Testing Challenges**: Different services required different testing approaches
5. **Resilience Inconsistency**: Some services had resilience patterns while others were fragile
6. **Type Safety Issues**: Inconsistent typing led to TypeScript errors, particularly with Drizzle ORM

We conducted an inventory of existing service patterns and identified several different approaches:

- Base Service Pattern
- Enhanced Service Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
- Standard Service Pattern
- Resilient Service Pattern

The variety of patterns created unnecessary cognitive load and inconsistent quality.

## Decision

We have decided to implement a standardized service pattern across all services in the ChainSync application. The standard pattern includes:

1. **Consistent Interface and Base Classes**:

   - All services extend from either `BaseService` or `EnhancedService`
   - Services implement standardized interfaces for their domain

2. **Dependency Injection Strategy**:

   - Services receive dependencies through a `ServiceConfig` object in constructors
   - A `ServiceFactory` manages service instantiation and dependency injection

3. **Error Handling**:

   - Standardized `ServiceError` class with consistent error codes
   - Consistent error propagation and translation
   - Proper logging of errors with context

4. **Transaction Management**:

   - Consistent transaction handling for database operations
   - Appropriate isolation levels for different operation types

5. **Resilience Patterns**:

   - Retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Circuit breakers for external dependencies
   - Fallback strategies for degraded operation

6. **Type Safety**:

   - Consistent use of TypeScript interfaces and types
   - Standardized handling of Drizzle ORM SQL template literals

7. **Validation**:
   - Input validation using Zod schemas
   - Consistent validation error handling

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Maintain Status Quo

**Pros**:

- No migration effort required
- No immediate risk of regressions

**Cons**:

- Continued maintenance challenges
- Increasing technical debt
- Inconsistent reliability and performance

### 2. Service Class Composition

**Pros**:

- More flexible than inheritance
- Could mix and match service capabilities

**Cons**:

- More complex implementation
- Potentially higher runtime overhead
- More difficult to enforce standards

### 3. Microservice Architecture

**Pros**:

- Strong service boundaries
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Technology diversity possible

**Cons**:

- Significantly higher operational complexity
- More complex testing and deployment
- Overkill for current application size and requirements

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Improved Developer Experience**:

   - Faster onboarding through consistent patterns
   - Reduced cognitive load when working across services
   - Better IDE support through consistent typing

2. **Enhanced Reliability**:

   - Consistent error handling and recovery
   - Resilience patterns applied uniformly
   - Better monitoring and observability

3. **Maintainability**:

   - Easier to maintain and extend services
   - Common patterns for common problems
   - More consistent code quality

4. **Type Safety**:
   - Fewer TypeScript errors
   - Consistent handling of Drizzle ORM operations
   - Better static analysis

### Negative

1. **Migration Effort**:

   - Significant effort to migrate existing services
   - Potential for regressions during migration
   - Need for comprehensive testing

2. **Learning Curve**:

   - Developers need to learn the new pattern
   - Some teams may resist the change

3. **Potential Overhead**:
   - Some simple services may have more boilerplate
   - Some performance overhead for very simple operations

## Implementation

The standard service pattern has been implemented through the following steps:

1. **Base Classes Creation**:

   - Created `BaseService` with core functionality
   - Extended with `EnhancedService` for database operations

2. **Service Factory**:

   - Implemented `ServiceFactory` for service instantiation
   - Configured with dependency injection

3. **Error Handling**:

   - Standardized `ServiceError` class
   - Defined consistent error codes and formats

4. **Migration Strategy**:

   - Created migration priority matrix
   - Migrated critical services first:
     - Authentication Service
     - Inventory Service
     - Loyalty Service

5. **Documentation**:

   - Created comprehensive service standard guide
   - Added inline documentation with examples

6. **Testing**:
   - Implemented unit tests for base classes
   - Created integration tests for migrated services

The migration is being rolled out incrementally, with a focus on critical services first, followed by other services based on the priority matrix.
