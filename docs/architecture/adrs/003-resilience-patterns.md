# ADR-003: Resilience Patterns

## Context

As the ChainSync system moved toward production readiness, we identified reliability as a critical concern. The application interacts with multiple external systems (payment processors, supplier APIs), relies on database operations that may experience transient failures, and needs to maintain service availability even when components experience degraded performance.

Analysis of the existing codebase revealed several reliability challenges:

1. **External API Dependencies**: Calls to payment gateways and supplier APIs did not handle transient failures gracefully
2. **Cascading Failures**: When one service failed, it often led to cascading failures across the system
3. **Database Error Handling**: Database operations were not resilient to transient failures like deadlocks or connection issues
4. **Recovery Mechanisms**: The system lacked mechanisms to recover from partial failures
5. **Service Degradation**: Services were not designed to operate in a degraded capacity when dependencies were unavailable

We needed a comprehensive approach to resilience that would allow the system to recover from transient failures, prevent cascading failures, and provide a stable experience to users even when underlying services experienced issues.

## Decision

We have decided to implement a suite of resilience patterns across the ChainSync system, including:

1. **Retry Utility**: A comprehensive retry system with:
   - Exponential backoff to prevent overwhelming recovering services
   - Jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
   - Configurable retry policies based on error types
   - Maximum retry limits and timeout parameters

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Circuit breakers that:
   - Track failure rates of dependent services
   - Automatically "trip" when failure thresholds are exceeded
   - Prevent unnecessary calls to failing services
   - Automatically test and reset after cooling periods
   - Provide monitoring and manual reset capabilities

3. **Fallback Strategies**: Fallback mechanisms that:
   - Provide alternative functionality when primary functions fail
   - Utilize cached data when live data is unavailable
   - Implement graceful degradation of features
   - Enable offline operation for critical functions

4. **Resilient HTTP Client**: A resilient HTTP client that:
   - Combines retry logic and circuit breaking
   - Handles common HTTP failure modes appropriately
   - Supports failover to alternate endpoints
   - Provides timeout management and cancellation

5. **Database Transaction Reliability**: Enhanced database operations with:
   - Automatic retries for transient errors like deadlocks
   - Connection pool management and health checks
   - Appropriate isolation levels for different operations
   - Transaction boundary management

These patterns are implemented as reusable components and integrated into the standardized service pattern.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Third-Party Resilience Libraries

**Pros**:
- Pre-built implementations of resilience patterns
- Community support and maintenance
- Potentially more feature-complete

**Cons**:
- Additional dependencies
- May not integrate well with our specific needs
- Learning curve for the team
- Potential performance overhead

### 2. Service Mesh Architecture

**Pros**:
- Resilience handled at infrastructure level
- Consistent application across all services
- Separation of concerns between business logic and resilience

**Cons**:
- Significant infrastructure complexity
- Operational overhead
- Overkill for our current application architecture
- Steeper learning curve

### 3. Status Quo with Improved Error Handling

**Pros**:
- Simpler implementation
- Lower development effort
- Fewer moving parts

**Cons**:
- Limited resilience capabilities
- No automatic recovery from failures
- Continued risk of cascading failures
- Higher operational burden during incidents

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Improved System Reliability**:
   - Better handling of transient failures
   - Automatic recovery from many failure modes
   - Prevention of cascading failures

2. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Fewer service disruptions
   - More consistent application behavior
   - Reduced error states visible to users

3. **Operational Benefits**:
   - Reduced incident frequency
   - Faster recovery from failures
   - Better visibility into system health
   - More targeted alerts and interventions

4. **Developer Experience**:
   - Consistent patterns for handling failures
   - Reusable components for common resilience needs
   - Better testing capabilities for failure scenarios

### Negative

1. **Implementation Complexity**:
   - More complex service implementations
   - Additional testing requirements
   - Learning curve for developers

2. **Performance Overhead**:
   - Small overhead for retry and circuit breaking logic
   - Additional monitoring and state tracking
   - Potential latency from retry attempts

3. **Testing Challenges**:
   - More complex testing scenarios
   - Need to simulate various failure modes
   - Potential for non-deterministic behavior

## Implementation

The resilience patterns have been implemented through the following components:

1. **Retry Utility**:
   - Configurable retry policies
   - Support for different backoff strategies
   - Error categorization for retry decisions
   - Monitoring and logging integration

2. **Circuit Breaker**:
   - State machine implementation (closed, open, half-open)
   - Failure counting and threshold configuration
   - Automatic testing and reset logic
   - Manual override capabilities

3. **Fallback Manager**:
   - Strategy pattern for fallback options
   - Cache integration for data fallbacks
   - Degraded mode operations
   - Clear feedback on fallback usage

4. **Resilient HTTP Client**:
   - Built on standard HTTP client
   - Integration with retry and circuit breaker
   - Timeout management
   - Fallback URL support

5. **Resilient Inventory Service Template**:
   - Reference implementation of resilience patterns
   - Documentation of pattern usage
   - Integration with service standard

Implementation has prioritized:
- Ease of use for developers
- Minimal performance overhead
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Clear documentation and examples
