# ADR-004: Database Connection Pooling

## Date

2025-05-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the ChainSync application prepared for production deployment, database performance emerged as a critical concern. Analysis of the existing database access patterns revealed several issues:

1. **Connection Management**: Each service established its own database connections, leading to connection proliferation
2. **Connection Lifecycle**: Connections were not properly managed throughout their lifecycle
3. **Query Performance**: No monitoring or tracking of slow queries
4. **Resource Utilization**: Inefficient use of database connections
5. **Scaling Challenges**: Database connection limitations would impact scaling
6. **Performance Visibility**: Limited visibility into database performance metrics

The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data access. Initial load testing showed that database connection management could become a bottleneck under increased load, particularly for multi-tenant scenarios with many concurrent users.

## Decision

We have decided to implement a centralized Database Connection Manager with connection pooling and performance monitoring capabilities. The implementation includes:

1. **Connection Pool Management**:
   - Configurable connection pools
   - Automatic connection lifecycle management
   - Health checks and connection validation
   - Graceful handling of connection errors

2. **Query Tracking and Metrics**:
   - Tracking of query execution time
   - Identification of slow queries
   - Per-query and aggregate performance metrics
   - Integration with OpenTelemetry for monitoring

3. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Connection reuse across services
   - Proper connection release
   - Transaction boundary management
   - Connection pool sizing based on workload

4. **Graceful Shutdown**:
   - Proper cleanup of connections on shutdown
   - Pending query completion handling
   - Connection draining during deployment

The `DbConnectionManager` is implemented as a singleton that services access through the `ServiceFactory`, aligning with our standardized service pattern.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. ORM-level Connection Management

**Pros**:
- Simpler implementation
- Built into Drizzle ORM
- Less custom code to maintain

**Cons**:
- Limited customization options
- Less visibility into connection behavior
- Fewer performance optimization opportunities
- Limited metrics and monitoring

### 2. Third-Party Connection Pool Libraries

**Pros**:
- Pre-built solutions with proven reliability
- Feature-rich implementations
- Community support

**Cons**:
- Additional dependencies
- Integration challenges with our architecture
- Potential mismatch with our specific needs
- Learning curve for the team

### 3. Microservice Database Pattern

**Pros**:
- Database isolation per service
- Simplified connection management
- Independent scaling

**Cons**:
- Data duplication and synchronization challenges
- Much higher operational complexity
- Transaction management across services
- Not aligned with our current architecture

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Improved Performance**:
   - More efficient use of database connections
   - Reduced connection establishment overhead
   - Better handling of connection peaks

2. **Enhanced Reliability**:
   - Proper handling of connection failures
   - Connection validation before use
   - Automatic recovery from transient issues

3. **Better Visibility**:
   - Comprehensive metrics on database performance
   - Identification of problematic queries
   - Integration with monitoring systems

4. **Scalability**:
   - Support for higher concurrent user counts
   - Better resource utilization
   - Controlled database load

### Negative

1. **Implementation Complexity**:
   - More complex connection management code
   - Need for careful transaction handling
   - Additional configuration requirements

2. **Migration Effort**:
   - Updating existing services to use the connection manager
   - Testing to ensure no regressions
   - Potential for subtle bugs during transition

3. **Operational Considerations**:
   - Tuning connection pool parameters
   - Monitoring connection pool health
   - Managing pool during deployments

## Implementation

The Database Connection Manager has been implemented with the following components:

1. **Connection Pool**:
   - Configurable min/max connections
   - Connection timeout and idle timeout settings
   - Connection validation before use
   - Automatic connection replacement

2. **Query Wrapper**:
   - Timing of query execution
   - Logging of slow queries
   - Error categorization and handling
   - Performance metrics collection

3. **Metrics Integration**:
   - OpenTelemetry integration for tracing
   - Prometheus metrics for monitoring
   - Query performance histograms
   - Pool utilization metrics

4. **Service Integration**:
   - Integration with `ServiceFactory`
   - Dependency injection into services
   - Consistent API for database access
   - Transaction management utilities

Implementation details include:

- Connection acquisition with timeout
- Proper error propagation
- Transaction isolation level management
- Query parameter logging for debugging
- Integration with the existing error handling system
