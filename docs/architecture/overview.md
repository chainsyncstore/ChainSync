## Key Architectural Principles

1. **Modularity**: The system is divided into distinct, loosely coupled modules with clear responsibilities.

2. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Functionality is exposed through well-defined service interfaces.

3. **Resilience**: The system implements patterns for handling failures gracefully, including retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, and fallback strategies.

4. **Performance**: Performance optimization is achieved through connection pooling, caching, query optimization, and monitoring.

5. **Security**: Security is implemented at multiple layers, including authentication, authorization, input validation, and rate limiting.

6. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging provide visibility into system behavior and performance.

## Core Subsystems

### Frontend Applications

The system includes multiple frontend applications:

- **Point of Sale (POS)**: Used by cashiers for in-store sales processing
- **Admin Dashboard**: Used by store managers and administrators for management tasks
- **Mobile App**: Used by customers for loyalty program access and store information

### API Layer

The API layer provides access to the system's functionality:

- **REST API Gateway**: Handles HTTP requests for all system operations
- **WebSocket Server**: Provides real-time updates for POS and mobile applications
- **Authentication**: Manages user identity and access control

### Core Services

The core business functionality is provided by the following services:

- **Store Management**: Manages store information, locations, and configurations
- **Inventory Management**: Tracks product inventory, stock movements, and batches
- **Product Management**: Manages product definitions, categories, prices, and attributes
- **Transaction Processing**: Handles sales transactions, returns, and payments
- **Customer Management**: Manages customer profiles and purchase history
- **Loyalty Program**: Handles loyalty points, rewards, and tiers
- **Subscription Management**: Manages recurring subscriptions and billing
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Provides business intelligence and reporting

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

These concerns apply across the entire system:

- **Security**: Provides authentication, authorization, and other security controls
- **Reliability & Resilience**: Implements patterns for handling failures
- **Performance Optimization**: Provides tools for optimizing system performance
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Provides visibility into system behavior

### External Integrations

The system integrates with external services:

- **Payment Processors**: Handles payment processing through Paystack and Flutterwave
- **Supplier APIs**: Integrates with supplier systems for inventory management
- **External Analytics**: Provides data to external analytics services

### Data Storage

The system uses multiple data storage mechanisms:

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database for structured data
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session storage
- **File Storage**: Used for storing product images and other assets

## Deployment Architecture

ChainSync is deployed on Render using a containerized architecture:

        WebService[Web Service]

        end

        subgraph "Databases"

        end
    end

    subgraph "External Services"
        PaymentAPI[Payment APIs]
        Storage[File Storage]
    end
