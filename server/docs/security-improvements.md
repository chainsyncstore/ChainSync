# ChainSync Security Improvements

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented for the ChainSync application, focusing on stabilizing core systems, fixing critical vulnerabilities, enhancing authentication, and preventing SQL injection attacks.

## Phase A - Security Improvements

### 1. XLSX Vulnerability Mitigation
- Implemented a `SecureXlsx` wrapper that validates and sanitizes input
- Added file size limits, sheet count limits, and row count limits
- Disabled high-risk features (formulas, HTML content)
- Enhanced `FileUtils` class with trust level system and signature validation

### 2. Secrets Management Encryption
- Replaced deprecated encryption methods with secure AES-256-GCM
- Implemented proper IV handling and authentication tags
- Added fail-fast behavior for missing encryption keys in production
- Improved error handling and logging for encryption/decryption processes

### 3. Authentication & SQL Injection Prevention
- Created a unified authentication service (`UnifiedAuthService`) to consolidate fragmented auth logic
- Implemented token-based authentication with Redis for persistence
- Added comprehensive session management features
- Created middleware for role-based and permission-based authorization
- Added account protection features:
  - Brute force protection (account lockout after failed attempts)
  - IP tracking for suspicious activity
  - Secure password reset flow

## SQL Injection Prevention Guidelines

To prevent SQL injection across the application, always follow these principles:

1. **Use Parameterized Queries**
   ```typescript
   // UNSAFE: String concatenation
   db.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ' + userId);
   
   // SAFE: Parameterized query
   db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [userId]);
   ```

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs before using them in queries
   - Use TypeScript's type system to enforce type safety
   - Implement domain-specific validation for IDs, emails, etc.

3. **Use ORMs When Possible**
   - Consider using an ORM like TypeORM or Prisma for safer database interactions
   - ORMs provide built-in protection against SQL injection

4. **Escape Special Characters**
   If parameterized queries aren't possible, ensure all special characters are escaped:
   ```typescript
   // Escape single quotes
   const safeString = unsafeString.replace(/'/g, "''");
   ```

5. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Database users should have the minimum privileges necessary
   - Separate read and write access when possible

## Token-Based Authentication Best Practices

The new `UnifiedAuthService` implements these best practices:

1. **Short-lived Access Tokens**
   - Access tokens expire after 15 minutes
   - Refresh tokens for seamless user experience

2. **Secure Token Storage**
   - Tokens stored in Redis with proper expiration
   - Refresh tokens as HTTP-only cookies, not localStorage

3. **Token Invalidation**
   - Ability to invalidate individual sessions
   - Support for logging out all sessions (e.g., after password change)

4. **Secure Password Handling**
   - Passwords hashed with bcrypt
   - Password reset tokens are one-time use only

## Error Handling Best Practices

1. **Consistent Error Format**
   - Standardized error responses with code, message, and details
   - Clear separation between user-facing and system errors

2. **Security Through Obscurity Avoidance**
   - Don't reveal sensitive information in error messages
   - Log detailed errors for debugging but return generic messages to users

3. **Authentication Failure Handling**
   - Same response time for existing and non-existing users (prevent timing attacks)
   - Generic "invalid credentials" message instead of specific failures

## Next Steps

1. **Implement CSRF Protection**
   - Add CSRF tokens to forms and state-changing operations

2. **Add Content Security Policy**
   - Implement CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks

3. **Security Headers**
   - Add security headers like HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.

4. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Schedule regular code reviews and security audits
   - Consider automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Consider IP-based and token-based rate limiting
